A popper is an element on the screen which \char`\"{}pops out\char`\"{} from the natural flow of your application. ~\newline
 Common examples of poppers are tooltips, popovers and drop-\/downs.\hypertarget{md__c___users_zhart__one_drive__desktop_school_capstone_workspace_capstone_flight_risk_assesment3d6ac541a236ec9ebde7bc079db87c86_autotoc_md486}{}\doxysubsection{So, yet another tooltip library?}\label{md__c___users_zhart__one_drive__desktop_school_capstone_workspace_capstone_flight_risk_assesment3d6ac541a236ec9ebde7bc079db87c86_autotoc_md486}
Well, basically, {\bfseries{no}}. ~\newline
 Popper.\+js is a {\bfseries{positioning engine}}, its purpose is to calculate the position of an element to make it possible to position it near a given reference element. ~\newline


The engine is completely modular and most of its features are implemented as {\bfseries{modifiers}} (similar to middlewares or plugins). ~\newline
 The whole code base is written in ES2015 and its features are automatically tested on real browsers thanks to \href{https://saucelabs.com/}{\texttt{ Sauce\+Labs}} and \href{https://travis-ci.org/}{\texttt{ Travis\+CI}}.

Popper.\+js has zero dependencies. No j\+Query, no Lo\+Dash, nothing. ~\newline
 It\textquotesingle{}s used by big companies like \href{https://getbootstrap.com/}{\texttt{ Twitter in Bootstrap v4}}, \href{https://github.com/OneNoteDev/WebClipper}{\texttt{ Microsoft in Web\+Clipper}} and \href{https://aui-cdn.atlassian.com/atlaskit/registry/}{\texttt{ Atlassian in Atlas\+Kit}}.\hypertarget{md__c___users_zhart__one_drive__desktop_school_capstone_workspace_capstone_flight_risk_assesment3d6ac541a236ec9ebde7bc079db87c86_autotoc_md487}{}\doxysubsubsection{Popper.\+js}\label{md__c___users_zhart__one_drive__desktop_school_capstone_workspace_capstone_flight_risk_assesment3d6ac541a236ec9ebde7bc079db87c86_autotoc_md487}
This is the engine, the library that computes and, optionally, applies the styles to the poppers.

Some of the key points are\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Position elements keeping them in their original DOM context (doesn\textquotesingle{}t mess with your DOM!);
\item Allows to export the computed informations to integrate with React and other view libraries;
\item Supports Shadow DOM elements;
\item Completely customizable thanks to the modifiers based structure;
\end{DoxyItemize}

Since lots of users just need a simple way to integrate powerful tooltips in their projects, we created {\bfseries{Tooltip.\+js}}. ~\newline
 It\textquotesingle{}s a small library that makes it easy to automatically create tooltips using as engine Popper.\+js. ~\newline
 Its API is almost identical to the famous tooltip system of Bootstrap, in this way it will be easy to integrate it in your projects. ~\newline
 The tooltips generated by Tooltip.\+js are accessible thanks to the {\ttfamily aria} tags.

$\ast$\+: Bower isn\textquotesingle{}t officially supported, it can be used to install Tooltip.\+js only trough the unpkg.\+com CDN. This method has the limitation of not being able to define a specific version of the library. Bower and Popper.\+js suggests to use npm or Yarn for your projects. ~\newline
 For more info, \href{https://github.com/FezVrasta/popper.js/issues/390}{\texttt{ read the related issue}}.\hypertarget{md__c___users_zhart__one_drive__desktop_school_capstone_workspace_capstone_flight_risk_assesment3d6ac541a236ec9ebde7bc079db87c86_autotoc_md490}{}\doxysubsubsection{Dist targets}\label{md__c___users_zhart__one_drive__desktop_school_capstone_workspace_capstone_flight_risk_assesment3d6ac541a236ec9ebde7bc079db87c86_autotoc_md490}
Popper.\+js is currently shipped with 3 targets in mind\+: UMD, ESM and ESNext.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item UMD -\/ Universal Module Definition\+: AMD, Require\+JS and globals;
\item ESM -\/ ES Modules\+: For webpack/\+Rollup or browser supporting the spec;
\item ESNext\+: Available in {\ttfamily dist/}, can be used with webpack and {\ttfamily babel-\/preset-\/env};
\end{DoxyItemize}

Make sure to use the right one for your needs. If you want to import it with a {\ttfamily $<$script$>$} tag, use UMD.\hypertarget{md__c___users_zhart__one_drive__desktop_school_capstone_workspace_capstone_flight_risk_assesment3d6ac541a236ec9ebde7bc079db87c86_autotoc_md491}{}\doxysubsection{Usage}\label{md__c___users_zhart__one_drive__desktop_school_capstone_workspace_capstone_flight_risk_assesment3d6ac541a236ec9ebde7bc079db87c86_autotoc_md491}
Given an existing popper DOM node, ask Popper.\+js to position it near its button


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{var reference = document.querySelector('.my-\/button');}
\DoxyCodeLine{var popper = document.querySelector('.my-\/popper');}
\DoxyCodeLine{var anotherPopper = new Popper(}
\DoxyCodeLine{    reference,}
\DoxyCodeLine{    popper,}
\DoxyCodeLine{    \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{        // popper options here}
\DoxyCodeLine{    \}}
\DoxyCodeLine{);}

\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{md__c___users_zhart__one_drive__desktop_school_capstone_workspace_capstone_flight_risk_assesment3d6ac541a236ec9ebde7bc079db87c86_autotoc_md492}{}\doxysubsubsection{Callbacks}\label{md__c___users_zhart__one_drive__desktop_school_capstone_workspace_capstone_flight_risk_assesment3d6ac541a236ec9ebde7bc079db87c86_autotoc_md492}
Popper.\+js supports two kinds of callbacks, the {\ttfamily on\+Create} callback is called after the popper has been initialized. The {\ttfamily on\+Update} one is called on any subsequent update.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{const reference = document.querySelector('.my-\/button');}
\DoxyCodeLine{const popper = document.querySelector('.my-\/popper');}
\DoxyCodeLine{new Popper(reference, popper, \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    onCreate: (data) => \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{        // data is an object containing all the informations computed}
\DoxyCodeLine{        // by Popper.js and used to style the popper and its arrow}
\DoxyCodeLine{        // The complete description is available in Popper.js documentation}
\DoxyCodeLine{    \},}
\DoxyCodeLine{    onUpdate: (data) => \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{        // same as `onCreate` but called on subsequent updates}
\DoxyCodeLine{    \}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\});}

\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{md__c___users_zhart__one_drive__desktop_school_capstone_workspace_capstone_flight_risk_assesment3d6ac541a236ec9ebde7bc079db87c86_autotoc_md493}{}\doxysubsubsection{Writing your own modifiers}\label{md__c___users_zhart__one_drive__desktop_school_capstone_workspace_capstone_flight_risk_assesment3d6ac541a236ec9ebde7bc079db87c86_autotoc_md493}
Popper.\+js is based on a \char`\"{}plugin-\/like\char`\"{} architecture, most of its features are fully encapsulated \char`\"{}modifiers\char`\"{}. ~\newline
 A modifier is a function that is called each time Popper.\+js needs to compute the position of the popper. For this reason, modifiers should be very performant to avoid bottlenecks. ~\newline


To learn how to create a modifier, \href{docs/_includes/popper-documentation.md\#modifiers--object}{\texttt{ read the modifiers documentation}}\hypertarget{md__c___users_zhart__one_drive__desktop_school_capstone_workspace_capstone_flight_risk_assesment3d6ac541a236ec9ebde7bc079db87c86_autotoc_md494}{}\doxysubsubsection{React, Vue.\+js, Angular, Angular\+JS, Ember.\+js (etc...) integration}\label{md__c___users_zhart__one_drive__desktop_school_capstone_workspace_capstone_flight_risk_assesment3d6ac541a236ec9ebde7bc079db87c86_autotoc_md494}
Integrating 3rd party libraries in React or other libraries can be a pain because they usually alter the DOM and drive the libraries crazy. ~\newline
 Popper.\+js limits all its DOM modifications inside the {\ttfamily apply\+Style} modifier, you can simply disable it and manually apply the popper coordinates using your library of choice. ~\newline


For a comprehensive list of libraries that let you use Popper.\+js into existing frameworks, visit the MENTIONS page.

Alternatively, you may even override your own {\ttfamily apply\+Styles} with your custom one and integrate Popper.\+js by yourself!


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{function applyReactStyle(data) \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    // export data in your framework and use its content to apply the style to your popper}
\DoxyCodeLine{\};}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{const reference = document.querySelector('.my-\/button');}
\DoxyCodeLine{const popper = document.querySelector('.my-\/popper');}
\DoxyCodeLine{new Popper(reference, popper, \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    modifiers: \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{        applyStyle: \{ enabled: false \},}
\DoxyCodeLine{        applyReactStyle: \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{            enabled: true,}
\DoxyCodeLine{            fn: applyReactStyle,}
\DoxyCodeLine{            order: 800,}
\DoxyCodeLine{        \},}
\DoxyCodeLine{    \},}
\DoxyCodeLine{\});}

Popper.\+js is very performant. It usually takes 0.\+5ms to compute a popper\textquotesingle{}s position (on an i\+Mac with 3.\+5G GHz Intel Core i5). ~\newline
