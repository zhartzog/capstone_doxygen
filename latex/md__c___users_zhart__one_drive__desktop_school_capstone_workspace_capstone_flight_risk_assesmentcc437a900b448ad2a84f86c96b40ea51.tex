{\bfseries{ATTENTION!}} To address many issues that have come up over the years, the API in v2 and above is not backwards compatible with the original \href{https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group/tree/v1-stable}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily React addon (v1-\/stable)}}}.

$\ast$$\ast$\+For a drop-\/in replacement for {\ttfamily react-\/addons-\/transition-\/group} and {\ttfamily react-\/addons-\/css-\/transition-\/group}, use the v1 release. Documentation and code for that release are available on the \href{https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group/tree/v1-stable}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily v1-\/stable}}} branch.$\ast$$\ast$

We are no longer updating the v1 codebase, please upgrade to the latest version when possible \end{quote}
