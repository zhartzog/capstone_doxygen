We have a handful of Cucumber features, but most of our testbed consists of RSpec examples. Please write RSpec examples for new code you create.\hypertarget{md__c___users_zhart__one_drive__desktop_school_capstone_workspace_capstone_flight_risk_assesmenta10553d3c11ffaa720d249b5ceb0288d_autotoc_md565}{}\doxysection{Submitting changes}\label{md__c___users_zhart__one_drive__desktop_school_capstone_workspace_capstone_flight_risk_assesmenta10553d3c11ffaa720d249b5ceb0288d_autotoc_md565}
Please send a \href{https://github.com/Hacker0x01/react-datepicker/pull/new/master}{\texttt{ Git\+Hub Pull Request}} with a clear list of what you\textquotesingle{}ve done (read more about \href{https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/}{\texttt{ pull requests}}). When you send a pull request, we will love you forever if you include a test to cover your changes. We can always use more test coverage. Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-\/line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this\+: \$ git commit -\/m \char`\"{}\+A summary of the commit $>$ $>$ A paragraph describing what changed and its impact.\char`\"{}\hypertarget{md__c___users_zhart__one_drive__desktop_school_capstone_workspace_capstone_flight_risk_assesmenta10553d3c11ffaa720d249b5ceb0288d_autotoc_md566}{}\doxysection{Coding conventions}\label{md__c___users_zhart__one_drive__desktop_school_capstone_workspace_capstone_flight_risk_assesmenta10553d3c11ffaa720d249b5ceb0288d_autotoc_md566}
Start reading our code, and you\textquotesingle{}ll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item We use prettier for code styling. Don\textquotesingle{}t worry about tabs vs spaces, or how to indent your code.
\item We use ESlint for all other coding standards. We try to be consistent and helpful.
\item This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them. It\textquotesingle{}s sort of like driving a car\+: Perhaps you love doing donuts when you\textquotesingle{}re alone, but with passengers, the goal is to make the ride as smooth as possible.

Local development configuration is pretty snappy. Here\textquotesingle{}s how to get set up\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Install/use node $>$=11.\+10.\+1
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Run {\ttfamily yarn link} from project root
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Run {\ttfamily cd docs-\/site \&\& yarn link react-\/datepicker}
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Run {\ttfamily yarn install} from project root
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Run {\ttfamily yarn build} from project root (at least the first time, this will get you the {\ttfamily dist} directory that holds the code that will be linked to)
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Run {\ttfamily yarn start} from project root
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Open new terminal window
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item After each JS change run {\ttfamily yarn build\+:js} in project root
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item After each SCSS change run {\ttfamily yarn run css\+:dev \&\& yarn run css\+:modules\+:dev} in project root
