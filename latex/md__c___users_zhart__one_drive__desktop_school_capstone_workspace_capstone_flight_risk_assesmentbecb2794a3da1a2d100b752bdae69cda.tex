Similar to Facebook\textquotesingle{}s (FB) invariant but only logs a warning if the condition is not met. This can be used to log issues in development environments in critical paths. Removing the logging code for production environments will keep the same logic and follow the same code paths.\hypertarget{md__c___users_zhart__one_drive__desktop_school_capstone_workspace_capstone_flight_risk_assesmentbecb2794a3da1a2d100b752bdae69cda_autotoc_md753}{}\doxysection{FAQ (\+READ before opening an issue)}\label{md__c___users_zhart__one_drive__desktop_school_capstone_workspace_capstone_flight_risk_assesmentbecb2794a3da1a2d100b752bdae69cda_autotoc_md753}

Why do you use {\ttfamily console.\+error} instead of {\ttfamily console.\+warn} ? \end{quote}
This is a mirror of Facebook\textquotesingle{}s (FB) \href{https://github.com/facebook/fbjs/blob/master/packages/fbjs/src/__forks__/warning.js}{\texttt{ warning}} module used within React\textquotesingle{}s source code (and other FB software). As such this module will mirror their code as much as possible.

The descision to use {\ttfamily error} over {\ttfamily warn} was made a long time ago by the FB team and isn\textquotesingle{}t going to change anytime soon.

Can I add X feature? \end{quote}
This is a mirror of Facebook\textquotesingle{}s (FB) \href{https://github.com/facebook/fbjs/blob/master/packages/fbjs/src/__forks__/warning.js}{\texttt{ warning}} and as such the source and signature will mirror that module.

If you believe a feature is missing than please open a feature request \href{https://github.com/facebook/fbjs}{\texttt{ there}}. If it is approved and merged in that this module will be updated to reflect that change, otherwise this module will not change.\hypertarget{md__c___users_zhart__one_drive__desktop_school_capstone_workspace_capstone_flight_risk_assesmentbecb2794a3da1a2d100b752bdae69cda_autotoc_md754}{}\doxysection{Use in Production}\label{md__c___users_zhart__one_drive__desktop_school_capstone_workspace_capstone_flight_risk_assesmentbecb2794a3da1a2d100b752bdae69cda_autotoc_md754}
It is recommended to add \href{https://github.com/4Catalyzer/babel-plugin-dev-expression}{\texttt{ babel-\/plugin-\/dev-\/expression}} with this module to remove warning messages in production. ~\newline
